      <div class="project-card">
        <img src="./img/berkeley.png" alt="Berkeley Algorithm">
        <h3>Berkeley Algorithm in Distributed Systems</h3>
        <p>Implemented the Berkeley algorithm in Python to synchronize clocks across multiple distributed nodes, ensuring consistency in a networked environment.</p>
      </div>
       </div>
        <div class="project-card">
        <img src="./img/semaphores.png" alt="Semaphores">
        <h3>Synchronization Using Semaphores â€“ Producer-Consumer Problem</h3>
        <p>Implemented the classic Producer-Consumer problem using semaphores to manage synchronization between threads. Ensured safe access to a shared buffer by handling mutual exclusion and avoiding race conditions in a multithreaded environment.</p>
      </div>
         <div class="project-card">
        <img src="./img/kernel.png" alt="Boatloader and kernel">
        <h3>Bootloader and kernel in assembly</h3>
        <p>Built a simple bootloader and a basic kernel using x86 Assembly. The bootloader loads the kernel from disk into memory, demonstrating low-level system initialization. This project showcases foundational OS concepts like memory management, hardware interfacing, and direct CPU control.</p>
